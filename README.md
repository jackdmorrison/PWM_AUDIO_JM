# PWM_AUDIO_JM
The aim of this project is to develop a Voltage controlled Oscillator using a Raspberry Pi Pico and integrate it into a euro rack synthesiser format. The product uses pulse width modulation to create an analogue oscillating voltage using a transformation circuit. This required investigating 2 methodologies for determining the duty cycle of the pulse width modulation circuit, using wave tables to determine the level or calculating the duty cycle at runtime. Further development went into both methods, developing different waveforms, with emphasis on the wave table solution that made its way into the final product. The Product was developed so that Oscillating frequency was determined by a Korg SQ-1 sequencer and integrated within a euro rack format. The product was implemented with an additional Oscillating output and testing concluded that the frequencies that were produced were accurate within Â±5% of the desired frequency. The waveforms were also produced accurately and the overall the project was successful.
